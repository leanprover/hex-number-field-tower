Core conformance checks for `HexNumberFieldTower`.

Oracle: PARI/GP through cypari2 for the external JSONL profile; the core
profile uses independent algebraic identities and committed exact coordinates.
Mode: `if_available`.

Covered operations:
- `ofQAdjoin` for rational, both selected conjugates, and non-unit or
  sign-normalized leading coefficients;
- all tower arithmetic operations over genuine one- and two-level fields,
  including recursive inversion and the `0⁻¹ = 0` convention;
- `adjoin?` for present roots and proper relative extensions;
- `factor?` and `checkFactorization` with content and multiplicity;
- `split?` for degenerate, repeated, and multi-step inputs;
- `flatten?` and both returned coordinate maps.

Covered properties:
- smart constructors preserve the selected absolute embedding and canonical
  mixed-radix dimensions;
- every public factorization reconstructs its input, retains multiplicity, and
  exposes only irreducible checked factors;
- adjoining chooses the unique factor compatible with the fixed embedding;
- splitting returns exactly the expected root count and multiplicities, and
  every returned root satisfies the input relation;
- flattening selects a primitive element of full degree and its two coordinate
  maps are inverse on committed tower generators.

Covered edge cases:
- a linear rational presentation, a negative-leading presentation, both
  conjugates, a non-unit leading coefficient, and the rational tower;
- adjoining a root already present in the tower;
- zero and constant polynomials;
- repeated factors and a polynomial whose roots lie in an intermediate level;
- a reducible absolute polynomial with a nonlinear irreducible relative factor;
- splitting a genuinely relative polynomial over a non-rational base;
- a quartic requiring two genuine splitting extensions.
