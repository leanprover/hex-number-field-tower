# hex-number-field-tower (depends on hex-number-field + hex-resultant + hex-berlekamp-zassenhaus)

Executable successive algebraic extensions of `ℚ`. The library supports
canonical arithmetic within a fixed tower, Trager factorization, adjoining a
specified algebraic root, constructing splitting fields, and flattening a tower
to one primitive-element presentation.

The tower is a field with a fixed embedding into `ℂ`, not an abstract field only
specified up to isomorphism. Every level therefore records both an irreducible
defining polynomial over the preceding tower and the absolute `AlgebraicRoot`
chosen as its generator.

## Representation

`opaque` below marks the public abstraction boundary, not the implementing
keyword, per the hex-number-field SPEC's representation convention; the
implementation seals `NumberTower` and `Elem` with `structure ... private
mk ::` so that `Internal.extend?` remains the only level admitter.

```lean
namespace Hex

opaque NumberTower

namespace NumberTower

def rat : NumberTower

/-- Canonical mixed-radix rational coordinates in `T`. -/
opaque Elem (T : NumberTower)

abbrev Poly (T : NumberTower) := DensePoly (Elem T)

instance : DecidableEq (Elem T)
instance : Zero (Elem T)
instance : One (Elem T)
instance : Add (Elem T)
instance : Sub (Elem T)
instance : Neg (Elem T)
instance : Mul (Elem T)
instance : Inv (Elem T)
instance : Div (Elem T)
instance : SMul Rat (Elem T)

def dim (T : NumberTower) : Nat
def coeffs (a : Elem T) : Array Rat

end NumberTower
end Hex
```

Internally, `NumberTower` is a validated array of levels. A level stores its
degree, the defining polynomial's coefficients as flattened rational coordinate
arrays over the preceding dimension, computational irreducibility evidence, and
the chosen absolute root. An element stores exactly `T.dim` rational coordinates
in the mixed-radix basis

```text
α₁^e₁ * ... * αₙ^eₙ,  0 ≤ eᵢ < dᵢ.
```

This flattened representation avoids a runtime-dependent Lean carrier while the
index `Elem T` still supplies the per-tower arithmetic operations required by
`DensePoly` gcd and resultant algorithms. Coordinate equality is exact within a
fixed checked tower. Inversion is totalized by `0⁻¹ = 0`. Rational scalar
multiplication acts coordinatewise; the Mathlib companion pins this executable
action as the `qsmul` field of its law-bearing `Field (Elem T)` structure.

Raw constructors are private. Only the smart constructors below may create a
`NumberTower`. Each level stores a successful executable factorization check and
a consistent chosen complex embedding by construction. The computational
library does not turn those Boolean checks into semantic irreducibility or claim
a `Lean.Grind.Field` instance; factorization-check soundness and the law-bearing
field structure live in the Mathlib companion.

## Dependent result types

```lean
namespace Hex.NumberTower

structure Extension (T : NumberTower) where
  tower   : NumberTower
  embed   : Elem T → Elem tower
  gen     : Elem tower
  root    : AlgebraicRoot

def checkFactorization (f : Poly T) (scalar : Elem T)
    (factors : Array (Poly T × Nat)) : Bool

structure Factorization (T : NumberTower) (f : Poly T) where
  scalar  : Elem T
  factors : Array (Poly T × Nat)
  checked : checkFactorization f scalar factors = true

inductive Roots (T : NumberTower) where
  | all
  | finite (roots : Array (Elem T × Nat))

structure Splitting (T : NumberTower) (f : Poly T) where
  extension : Extension T
  roots     : Roots extension.tower

structure Flattening (T : NumberTower) where
  root          : AlgebraicNumber
  toPrimitive   : Elem T → QAdjoin root.p root.x
  fromPrimitive : QAdjoin root.p root.x → Elem T

end Hex.NumberTower
```

`Factorization.checked` is an executable certificate that the scalar and
monic positive-multiplicity factor array reconstruct the input and that every
listed factor passes the tower irreducibility checker. The companion gives its
semantic interpretation. Factors are sorted lexicographically by canonical
coordinate arrays. The zero polynomial has scalar zero and an empty factor array.
`Roots.all` records that every element is a root of the zero polynomial.

## Constructors and operations

```lean
namespace Hex.NumberTower

/-- Build a one-level tower for the irreducible presentation `ℚ(x)`. -/
def ofQAdjoin [ZPoly.CheckedIrreducible p]
    (hsf : HasOnlySimpleRoots p)
    (rep : RefinedIsolation p) (h : SimpleRoot.mk rep = x) :
    Extension rat

/-- Adjoin the selected absolute algebraic root to `T`. -/
def adjoin? (T : NumberTower) (a : AlgebraicRoot) : Option (Extension T)

/-- Complete irreducible factorization with multiplicity. -/
def factor? (T : NumberTower) (f : Poly T) : Option (Factorization T f)

/-- Construct an extension in which `f` splits into linear factors. -/
def split? (T : NumberTower) (f : Poly T) : Option (Splitting T f)

/-- Replace the whole tower by one canonical primitive-element field. -/
def flatten? (T : NumberTower) : Option (Flattening T)

end Hex.NumberTower
```

`ofQAdjoin` takes squarefreeness explicitly because its returned extension
stores an `AlgebraicRoot`. Although irreducibility implies squarefreeness in
characteristic zero, that implication belongs to the Mathlib companion, while
`HasOnlySimpleRoots p` is already decidable and can be supplied by a
Mathlib-free caller.

These operations retain `Option` because their successful results contain new
dependent carrier indices and certificates; there is no honest junk
`Extension T` or `Flattening T` with which to implement a `panicWith` wrapper.
The Mathlib companion proves every result is `some` for a valid input. Callers
may preserve the checked API or eliminate `none` using those theorems.

## Embedding invariant

For a tower with generators `α₁, ..., αₙ`, each level polynomial `fᵢ` must satisfy

```text
fᵢ(αᵢ) = 0
```

after coefficients from the lower tower are evaluated through the already chosen
embedding into `ℂ`. Irreducibility alone is insufficient: it would define an
isomorphic abstract extension but could choose the wrong conjugate.

The computational layer enforces the invariant through constructor-produced
certificates:

- `ofQAdjoin` uses its supplied matching `RefinedIsolation`.
- `adjoin?` selects the unique irreducible factor that vanishes at the requested
  `AlgebraicRoot` under the current embedding.
- `split?` calls `adjoin?` for every new generator.

If serialization is later added, decoding must rerun these validations. No raw
level decoder may be public.

## Tower arithmetic

Addition and negation act coordinatewise. Multiplication recursively convolves
mixed-radix coordinates and reduces from the highest generator downward by each
monic defining polynomial. Inversion uses extended gcd in the top polynomial
quotient and recurses into the lower coefficient field. `rat` has dimension one
and identifies `Elem rat` with `Rat`.

The computational layer implements the quotient operations, including
`inv 0 = 0`. The companion turns the checked factorization evidence into
semantic irreducibility and proves the field laws, following the quotient-field
pattern of `QAdjoin` and `hex-gfq-field`.

## Trager factorization

`factor? T f` first separates content and runs Yun decomposition over `Elem T`.
Each squarefree component is factored independently, and the Yun index is the
output multiplicity. This rule is mandatory; factoring the whole input norm and
recovering multiplicity afterward is not accepted.

For one squarefree component `g`:

1. If `T = rat`, clear denominators and factor `g` directly with
   Berlekamp-Zassenhaus over `ℤ`.
2. Otherwise write `T = K(αₙ)`, let `d` be the top defining-polynomial degree,
   and let `m = degree g`. For `N = d * m`, define

   ```text
   tragerShiftCount(d, m) = choose(N, 2) + 1.
   ```

   Enumerate exactly that many distinct shifts in the deterministic order
   `0, 1, -1, 2, -2, ...`.
3. For each `c`, substitute `X - c * αₙ` and compute only the one-level norm
   `Res_Y(mₙ(Y), g(X - cY))`, a polynomial over `K`.
4. Accept the first shift whose one-level norm is squarefree over `K`. Among the
   `N` conjugate shifted roots, each unordered pair excludes at most one integer
   shift, so `tragerShiftCount` proves that the bounded search succeeds.
5. Recursively call the same factorization algorithm on that norm over `K`.
6. Embed each returned lower-tower factor into `Poly T`, take its gcd with the
   shifted component, undo the shift, normalize monically, and discard
   constants.
7. Verify that the recovered factors reconstruct the component and pass the
   tower factorization checker.

Each recursive step uses a one-level executable resultant, not a determinant
materialized as a dense matrix. It is intentionally not replaced by one absolute
norm: a factor defined over an intermediate field can make the absolute norm a
repeated power for every top-generator shift. `hex-resultant-mathlib` full
agreement is required to prove that the norm factorization and gcd recovery are
complete.

## Adjoining roots

`adjoin? T a` lifts `a.p` to `Poly T`, factors it, and evaluates each factor under
the fixed embedding of `T` together with `a.toComplex`. The
`evalDisambiguationPrec` construction from `hex-number-field`, applied to each
factor evaluation eliminant, refutes every wrong factor. The selected factor
passes the recursive irreducibility checker and becomes the new defining
polynomial; its semantic irreducibility is a companion theorem.

If the selected factor is linear, `a` already belongs to the embedded tower. The
result is an identity extension with `tower = T`, `embed = id`, and `gen` equal
to the recovered tower element. Otherwise append one validated level.

## Splitting fields

`split? T f` returns `Roots.all` for zero and a finite empty array for a nonzero
constant, without extending the tower. For a nonconstant polynomial:

1. Factor over the current tower.
2. For each nonlinear irreducible factor, compute an absolute integer eliminant
   by recursively taking norms to `ℚ`.
3. Isolate the eliminant roots and retain a root that zeros the original factor
   under the current embedding.
4. Call `adjoin?`, map the remaining polynomial into the returned tower, and
   refactor.
5. Stop when every factor is linear; collect equal roots into positive
   multiplicity buckets.

Every nonidentity adjoining step makes one selected factor linear, so the sum of
remaining nonlinear degrees decreases. This supplies the outer termination
measure. The returned extension is generated only by roots of the input.

## Flattening

`flatten?` combines the fixed generators one level at a time. For generators
`θ` and `α`, enumerate the same deterministic integer shifts and try
`γ = θ + c * α`. Compute its integer eliminant by iterated resultants and accept
the first candidate whose irreducible factor has degree equal to the combined
dimension at that generator-adjoining step. This degree test is the executable
primitive-element certificate.

At a generator-adjoining step, write `n = deg θ`, `M = deg α`, and let the
combined dimension be `d`. Both a degree collision and a non-linear recovery
gcd require a conjugate pair satisfying
`θᵢ - θ₁ = c * (α₁ - αⱼ)` with `αⱼ ≠ α₁`. Thus both failure modes form one set
of at most `n * (M - 1)` bad shifts. A proper relative level has degree at
least two, so `n ≤ d / 2`; the absolute field `ℚ(α)` is a subfield of the
combined field, so `M ≤ d`. Hence the shared bad set has size at most
`choose(d, 2)`. The zero shift is included among the possible bad values, so
the count does not require a separate nonzero case.

Set `flattenShiftCount(d) = choose(d, 2) + 1` and test that many values in
signed order beginning with zero. The direct scan accepts only full-degree
candidates whose validated linear-gcd coordinates succeed, and otherwise
continues without invoking trace recovery. If it is exhausted,
`AlgebraicPoly.Common.extendShift?` retains the maximum-degree candidate from
the same bounded primitive-element search; the companion theorem proves that
this candidate generates the compositum. The Mathlib companion proves both
searches and checked canonicalization total on valid algebraic inputs.
Candidate factor selection uses `evalDisambiguationPrec`, so both shift
searches and root selection have input-computable finite bounds.

For an accepted `γ = θ + cα`, first lift the minimal polynomials of `θ` and `α`
into `ℚ(γ)[Y]` and take the gcd of `mα(Y)` with `mθ(γ - cY)`. A linear gcd gives
coordinates for `α` and `θ = γ - cα`, which are validated against their
canonical algebraic values. Direct scanning accepts only this fast path. For
the maximum-degree fallback, failed fast recovery is followed by exact trace
pairing in the proved-equal generated field. Substitute the prior generator
coordinates through the recovered `θ`. These coordinate expressions define
`toPrimitive`; evaluation at the corresponding tower element defines
`fromPrimitive`. Verify their composite on a rational basis of the tower and
verify that the tower element representing `γ` zeros its claimed minimal
polynomial before returning. The accepted `γ` is already the canonical
`AlgebraicNumber` stored by `Flattening`.

## Conformance

- *core*: rational tower identity; `ℚ(√2)` arithmetic; the two-level tower
  `ℚ(√2, √3)`; adjoining a root already present; factorization of a polynomial
  with repeated factors; splitting a quadratic and a quartic; flattening both
  one-level and two-level towers; flattening coordinate recovery and round trips.
- Every public operation has typical, edge, and adversarial cases. Adversarial
  cases include a bad first Trager shift, conjugate factor impostors, and a
  reducible absolute polynomial whose selected relative factor is irreducible.
  Factor `X² - 3` in `ℚ(√2, √3)` to ensure a polynomial whose linear factors
  live over the intermediate field `ℚ(√3)` is handled by recursive one-level
  Trager rather than an absolute-norm squarefreeness test.
- *ci*: deterministic fixtures checked independently with cypari2 `nfinit`,
  `nffactor`, and splitting-field operations.
- *local*: taller towers and optional Nemo/Hecke comparisons.

Sage is not an oracle. CI extends the existing single ubuntu job and does not add
a matrix or a new workflow.

### Phase-4 input families

- `tower-coordinate-arithmetic`: bounded-height dense coordinates in checked
  presentations. Multiplication varies the top degree over `ℚ(√2)`;
  inversion and division use `ℚ(3^(1/m), √2)` so the fixed quadratic top
  quotient performs genuine recursive arithmetic in the varying lower field.
- `trager-factorization`: Selmer trinomials over `ℚ(√2)` for the inclusive
  retry/gcd/replay route, plus irreducible Selmer inputs over
  `ℚ(√2, √3)` for genuine recursive relative factorization.
- `adjoin-extend`: fixed-embedding adjoining and identity adjoining, with a
  separate checked rational-presentation family.
- `split-flatten`: repeated quartic splitting, primitive-element flattening,
  recovery/certification adversaries, and completed coordinate maps.

## Complexity and Phase 4 budgets

Let `D = T.dim`, `n = deg f`, and let `H` bound coefficient height.

- Coordinate addition, subtraction, negation, and rational scalar action cost
  `O(D)` bounded-height rational operations. `ofQAdjoin` constructs and walks
  `O(D)` presentation data. Schoolbook multiplication and reduction cost
  `O(D²)` before later fast-arithmetic work.
- Inversion runs the monic one-sided extended gcd of the top-level coordinate
  polynomial against the defining relation over the lower field
  (`DensePoly.xgcdLeftMonic`), recursing into lower-field inversion once per
  normalization. Every remainder is made monic before it divides, so each
  recursive inversion acts on a normalized operand; the unnormalized chain
  re-ran lower-field inversions on height-amplified quotient coefficients.
  On the registered height-two family `ℚ(3^(1/n), √2)` the chain performs a
  constant number of lower-field inversions and products, each `O(n²)`
  coordinate operations at growing limb widths; the registered family model
  is `n² log n`, with the logarithmic factor as the limb-growth proxy, and
  the conservative worst case is `O(D³ log D)` rational operations. Division
  is inversion followed by one `O(D²)` product by the inverse, whose
  coordinate height is that of the inverse.
- A Trager step at `K(α)/K` tries at most
  `choose(deg(mα) * n, 2) + 1` one-level resultants, then recursively factors one
  accepted norm of degree at most `deg(mα) * n` over `K`. The base case performs
  one rational factorization. This recurrence, rather than one absolute-norm
  factorization cost, is the implementation budget.
- `split?` repeats factorization after genuine degree-reducing extensions.
- `flatten?` computes primitive-element eliminants of degree at most `D`, uses
  validated linear-gcd recovery while scanning full-degree candidates, and
  applies exact trace pairing once if the maximum-degree fallback is needed.
  One dense flattening `toPrimitive` application costs `O(D²)` rational
  operations; one `fromPrimitive` application costs `O(D³)` with the current
  Horner/tower-arithmetic path. Applying `fromPrimitive` to all `D` basis
  vectors gives the registered `O(D⁴)` family. One dense `toPrimitive` call
  has bit cost set by the flattening's primitive-basis images, whose heights
  are fixed by the accepted primitive-element shift rather than by the
  dimension, so it has no one-parameter wall model in the dimension and is a
  canonical mode-3 case below.

The fixed canonical cases for adjoining, identity adjoining, one- and
two-level factorization, checked replay, splitting, flattening, division at
the top rung of the recursive family, and one dense `toPrimitive` call use
zero-grace whole-child ceilings derived from clean reference-host measurements
plus stated margin. These budgets do not replace the contracts above; they are
mode-3 regression ceilings for operations whose realised phase mixtures admit
neither a tight family model nor a published bound covering the dominant
executable phases.

Negation has mode-1 evidence on dense bounded-height coordinate arrays at
dimensions 128 through 448. The source-derived linear model covers one public
negation plus structural result hashing; its exactly sized result constructor
does not copy or normalize the coordinate array. `Elem.mk` remains private;
the checked constructor is exposed only as `Internal.ofCoeffs`, and requires a
proof that the supplied array has exactly the tower dimension.

Inversion has mode-1 evidence on the recursive family. Division and dense
`toPrimitive` are mode-3 surfaces: the inverse's coordinate height crosses a
64-bit limb boundary inside the measured range, and the primitive images'
heights are input-determined, so neither admits a one-parameter wall model;
the headline report records the attempted schedules and their residuals. The
fixed unit-basis registration and the dimension-four arithmetic
registrations are hash anchors, not performance evidence.

Merge-facing conformance remains restricted to tower dimension at most 8 and
input degree at most 4; the degree-24 factorization case is scientific
performance evidence, not a merge-facing conformance fixture.

## External comparators

**PARI/GP nffactor via cypari2** (https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/, driven
through the cypari2 binding, the same binding the conformance oracle uses) —
**informational**, scoped to the `factor?` bench targets. `nffactor(nfinit f,
t)` is the callable PARI unit surface for factoring a polynomial over a
number field, the semantic task of `factor?` at one level. It is wired as a
persistent-subprocess process call (`scripts/oracle/pari_bench_driver.py`,
`Hex/BenchOracle/Pari.lean`) with per-rung fixed Lean/PARI registration
pairs on shared deterministic Selmer trinomial inputs over `ℚ(√2)`, joined
on the sorted factor degree/multiplicity multiset hash (factor coefficients
live in each system's own field presentation and are not a shared
observable; the degree/multiplicity multiset of a complete factorization
is). PARI is a mature optimized C library running over `nfinit`'s absolute
integral-basis presentation with maximal-order machinery, so the gap is
structural; the ratio is recorded for orientation and does not gate Phase 4.

Absence declarations, all with reason
**no-comparable-surface-in-named-comparator**:

- *Tower element arithmetic* (`Elem` add/sub/neg/mul/inv/div/smul): PARI's
  number-field element operations (`nfelt*`) act on absolute integral-basis
  coordinates after `nfinit`, not on relative mixed-radix tower coordinates
  with a fixed embedding; nested `t_POLMOD` towers are not a supported
  arithmetic surface for inversion. There is no callable PARI unit matching
  arithmetic in this representation.
- *Adjoining, splitting, flattening* (`adjoin?`, `split?`, `flatten?`):
  PARI's `nfsplitting`, `polcompositum`, and `rnfequation` return abstract
  defining polynomials up to isomorphism; they do not produce the
  fixed-embedding root selection, coordinate maps, or validated tower level
  that constitute these results, so they compute a different semantic task
  than these units.
